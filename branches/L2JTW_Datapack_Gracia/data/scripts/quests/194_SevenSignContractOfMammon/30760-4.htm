The Order of Dawn is concerned about the <font color="LEVEL">contract with the Merchants of Mammon</font>.<br>
We suspect it is somehow connected with the recent deaths of a number of Dwarves who traded with the Merchants of Mammon.<br>
According to our investigation, the murdererous monster who killed those Dwarven cantractors seemed to be looking for something...<br>
We think that something is the <font color="LEVEL">contract between Empror Shunaiman and the Merchants of Mammon</font>.<br>
Therefore, we believe we must find the contract before it does.<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 194_SevenSignContractOfMammon 30760-5.htm">"Do you have any idea where the contract might be?"</a>
