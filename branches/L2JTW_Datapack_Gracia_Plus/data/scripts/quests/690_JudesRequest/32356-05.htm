You don't have 200 evil weapons yet? Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">monsters in the Hellbound Island</font>, you should be able to obtain them. Keep trying! Collect <font color="LEVEL">200</font> evil weapons and bring them to me, I'll give you a very nice piece of paper, supposedly a recipe for some sort of weapon.<br>
or you can trade 5 evil weapons for piece of weapons.<br>
