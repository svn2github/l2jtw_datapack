<html><body>Secret Agent Colin:<br>
Sir Athebaldt sent you? Ah, you must be that adventurer he spoke of, the one who defeated the monster...<br>
Well, let me formally introduce myself. I'm <font color="LEVEL">Secreg Agent Colin</font> from the Order of Dawn. Nice to meet you.<br>
Lets get to business. There's not much time left. And we don't know when the monster will make its move.<br>
To get the <font color="LEVEL">Contract</font> we need, you must infiltrate the <font color="LEVEL">Sanctum of Dawn</font>, where the Order's highest-ranking priests offer the oracle.<br>
But you certainly can't go looking like that...<br>
