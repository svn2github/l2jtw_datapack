Yes, I remember...<br>
The past is our mission failed, not many have experienced it.<br>
Sadly, we had to surrender their positions and chased, leaving pozati bodies of our brothers.<br>
Along with them was lost an important document, he was a researcher <font color="LEVEL"> Medivalya </font>. I think just this document and want SARS.<br>
You should go to <font color="LEVEL"> Seed of Destruction </font> and get the document with the body Medivalya.<br>
Not zastyavlyay coming. Go now. Good luck to you!
